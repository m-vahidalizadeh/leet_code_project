/**
 * Seating Arrangements
 * There are n guests attending a dinner party, numbered from 1 to n. The ith guest has a height of arr[i] inches.
 * The guests will sit down at a circular table which has n seats, numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order around
 * the table. As the host, you will choose how to arrange the guests, one per seat. Note that there are n! possible
 * permutations of seat assignments.
 * Once the guests have sat down, the awkwardness between a pair of guests sitting in adjacent seats is defined as
 * the absolute difference between their two heights. Note that, because the table is circular, seats 1 and n are
 * considered to be adjacent to one another, and that there are therefore n pairs of adjacent guests.
 * The overall awkwardness of the seating arrangement is then defined as the maximum awkwardness of any pair of
 * adjacent guests. Determine the minimum possible overall awkwardness of any seating arrangement.
 * Signature
 * int minOverallAwkwardness(int[] arr)
 * Input
 * n is in the range [3, 1000].
 * Each height arr[i] is in the range [1, 1000].
 * Output
 * Return the minimum achievable overall awkwardness of any seating arrangement.
 * Example
 * n = 4
 * arr = [5, 10, 6, 8]
 * output = 4
 * If the guests sit down in the permutation [3, 1, 4, 2] in clockwise order around the table (having
 * heights [6, 5, 8, 10], in that order), then the four awkwardnesses between pairs of adjacent guests will
 * be |6-5| = 1, |5-8| = 3, |8-10| = 2, and |10-6| = 4, yielding an overall awkwardness of 4. It's impossible
 * to achieve a smaller overall awkwardness.
