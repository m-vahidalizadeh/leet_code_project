/**
 * 99. Recover Binary Search Tree
 * You are given the root of a binary search tree (BST), where exactly two nodes of the tree were swapped by mistake. Recover the tree without changing its structure.
 *
 * Follow up: A solution using O(n) space is pretty straight forward. Could you devise a constant space solution?
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: root = [1,3,null,null,2]
 * Output: [3,1,null,null,2]
 * Explanation: 3 cannot be a left child of 1 because 3 > 1. Swapping 1 and 3 makes the BST valid.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: root = [3,1,4,null,null,2]
 * Output: [2,1,4,null,null,3]
 * Explanation: 2 cannot be in the right subtree of 3 because 2 < 3. Swapping 2 and 3 makes the BST valid.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 1000].
 * -231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1
