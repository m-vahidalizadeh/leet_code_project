/**
 * 1269. Number of Ways to Stay in the Same Place After Some Steps
 * You have a pointer at index 0 in an array of size arrLen. At each step, you can move 1 position to the left, 1 position to the right in the array or stay in the same place  (The pointer should not be placed outside the array at any time).
 *
 * Given two integers steps and arrLen, return the number of ways such that your pointer still at index 0 after exactly steps steps.
 *
 * Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: steps = 3, arrLen = 2
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: There are 4 differents ways to stay at index 0 after 3 steps.
 * Right, Left, Stay
 * Stay, Right, Left
 * Right, Stay, Left
 * Stay, Stay, Stay
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: steps = 2, arrLen = 4
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: There are 2 differents ways to stay at index 0 after 2 steps
 * Right, Left
 * Stay, Stay
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: steps = 4, arrLen = 2
 * Output: 8
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= steps <= 500
 * 1 <= arrLen <= 10^6
