/**
 * 1665. Minimum Initial Energy to Finish Tasks
 * You are given an array tasks where tasks[i] = [actuali, minimumi]:
 *
 * actuali is the actual amount of energy you spend to finish the ith task.
 * minimumi is the minimum amount of energy you require to begin the ith task.
 * For example, if the task is [10, 12] and your current energy is 11, you cannot start this task. However, if your current energy is 13, you can complete this task, and your energy will be 3 after finishing it.
 *
 * You can finish the tasks in any order you like.
 *
 * Return the minimum initial amount of energy you will need to finish all the tasks.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: tasks = [[1,2],[2,4],[4,8]]
 * Output: 8
 * Explanation:
 * Starting with 8 energy, we finish the tasks in the following order:
 *     - 3rd task. Now energy = 8 - 4 = 4.
 *     - 2nd task. Now energy = 4 - 2 = 2.
 *     - 1st task. Now energy = 2 - 1 = 1.
 * Notice that even though we have leftover energy, starting with 7 energy does not work because we cannot do the 3rd task.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: tasks = [[1,3],[2,4],[10,11],[10,12],[8,9]]
 * Output: 32
 * Explanation:
 * Starting with 32 energy, we finish the tasks in the following order:
 *     - 1st task. Now energy = 32 - 1 = 31.
 *     - 2nd task. Now energy = 31 - 2 = 29.
 *     - 3rd task. Now energy = 29 - 10 = 19.
 *     - 4th task. Now energy = 19 - 10 = 9.
 *     - 5th task. Now energy = 9 - 8 = 1.
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: tasks = [[1,7],[2,8],[3,9],[4,10],[5,11],[6,12]]
 * Output: 27
 * Explanation:
 * Starting with 27 energy, we finish the tasks in the following order:
 *     - 5th task. Now energy = 27 - 5 = 22.
 *     - 2nd task. Now energy = 22 - 2 = 20.
 *     - 3rd task. Now energy = 20 - 3 = 17.
 *     - 1st task. Now energy = 17 - 1 = 16.
 *     - 4th task. Now energy = 16 - 4 = 12.
 *     - 6th task. Now energy = 12 - 6 = 6.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= tasks.length <= 105
 * 1 <= actualâ€‹i <= minimumi <= 104
